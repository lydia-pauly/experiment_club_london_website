    <p id="welcome-banner">Welcome to the London Experiment Club!</p>
    <p>This is a social club that will be set up in London and follows this format:</p>
    
    <p>Members meet once a month. During the meeting, a theme is chosen (most likely following Rob Walker's <a href="https://robwalker.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Art of Noticing</a>). Each member then chooses a craft or area they would like to 'experiment' in. The rules for what you can choose are:</p>
    <ol id="experiment-rules-list">
        <li>It must be something that you can continuously 'produce' and 'experiment' in (i.e. it is something you can attempt multiple times with different variations and record the results with).</li>
        <li>It must be something that can be connected to the theme in some way.</li>
        <li>Your experiments must be recordable in some way.</li>
        <li>Each experiment has a reason behind it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each member takes a month to experiment upon the theme in their chosen craft or area. We come back next month and talk about what we did, the experiments we tried, and where it took us. And then the cycle starts again!</p>
    <p>The club follows these principles:</p>
    <ol id="principles-list">
        <li><span class="highlight-colour-2">Process over final product</span>: we are much more interested in the journey you took across the month than what you made at the end of it.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight-colour-2">Intentional pathmaking over mindless production</span>: we want to hear how you charted your journey through your experimentation and what each step was, much more than ideas that just came to you.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight-colour-2">Notebooks over pieces</span>: we prioritise exploratory messiness, volume, interest, and change over careful, individual, polished delivery.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>The club is still being set up (by me!) so if you are seeing this, you have stumbled upon this too early. Come back later to find membership details. :)</p>
